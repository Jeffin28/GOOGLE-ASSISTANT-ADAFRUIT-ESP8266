**Adafruit IO** is a platform designed to display, respond, and interact with your project's data. Display your data in real-time, online Make your project internet-connected: Control motors, read sensor data, and more! Connect projects to web services like Twitter, RSS feeds, weather services, etc. Connect your project to other internet-enabled devices. Adafruit MQTT is widely used in IoT (Internet of Things) embedded applications, where every sensor is connected to a server and we have access to control them over the internet. The MQTT Client module of NodeMCU is according to version 3.1.1 of the MQTT protocol. Make sure that your broker supports and is correctly configured for version 3.1.1. letâ€™s see the functions used for MQTT on NodeMCU.
IFTTT defines a clear and concise protocol which your serviceâ€™s API will implement. Each trigger and action for your service will map 1-to-1 to an API endpoint on your service built specifically for IFTTT. Trigger endpoints will be event streams that IFTTT will poll for new data. Conversely, action endpoints will be writable endpoints that IFTTT will send data to. For services that use OAuth, IFTTT is fully compatible with a couple of the common flavours of OAuth 2.0.


## Concept

<div align="center">  
  
I have used a `publish`and `subscribe` method for current demonstration.**ESP8266-12E** module incuded as a microcontroller for the communication with **AWS IoT Core**.

</div>

Here we have some points to note:

> - You must need an **AWS IoT Core** console/account for the demonstation.Details on below section (**Steps**). 
> - This concept works on ESP8266 Arduino Core v2.4.2 and v2.4.0.
> - Communications are secured by TLS version 1.2. Arduino IDE & ESP8266 Suports TLS V1.2.
> - **AWS IoT Core** supports `MQTT` and `MQTT over WSS` protocols. We are using ***MQTT over WSS*** method with ***sigv4*** authentication and port **443**.


## Software
* [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) for Windows, Linux or Mac OS.

## Steps :
 1. **Download** the repo.
 
 2. For those who don't have an ***AWS IoT core*** ðŸ˜‡ download the ***AWS IOT CORE WITH ESP8266*** named pdf from the **DOC** folder and carefully read it. 
     Create a dashboard with at least one ***thing***. Create your **AWS** account [here](https://aws.amazon.com/).
   
 3. Open **LIB** folder from the downloaded repo then extract the `ZIP` file and place the four folders into your Arduino local directory folder
    (libraries). Folders(libraries) with name given below :
    
    - aws-mqtt-websockets-master
    - AWS-SDK-ESP8266
    - PubSubClient
    - WebSockets
    
    You have an alternate option to download the library from the Arduino library manager. But I am not suggesting that way in this case ðŸ‘Ž. 
    
 4. The **source code** for our ESP8266 simulation can be found in the **CODE** folder. Open **source code** from the downloaded repo and make some changes as mentioned below :
   
   - Open **global.h** and provide your wifi router's `ssid` and `password` :

</p  
  
<p><br> 
  
   - Open **aws.cpp** and fill your credentials here ðŸ‘‡ . For more info refer the document page ***number 9***.

## Compatibility
This library was tested with the NodeMCU V1.0 & ESP8266-12E board. It should also work with other standard ESP8266 that are compatible with the Arduino IDE.
ESP8266 core version that I have tested is `2.4.2`. 

## Working & Testing
